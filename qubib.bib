@Comment HOW TO ADD NEW ENTRIES

@Comment GENERATE YOUR KEY

@Comment The idea is to follow the following rule so that keys are permanent

@Comment 1. First letters of authors, capitalized, in the order of appearance

@Comment    No more than 4 authors

@Comment    If more than 4, add a '+'

@Comment 2. Year of publication

@Comment 3. ':'

@Comment 4. First word of the title, skip "On", "The", "A", lowecase

@Comment DO NOT SORT THE NEW ENTRIES

@Comment It is easirer to find new additions if they are grouped at the top of the file

@Comment INSERT YOUR ENTRIES BELOW

@Comment INSERT YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS LINE

                  algorithms in an exponentially large computational
                  space. Here we report the use of a processor with

                  quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a
                  computational state-space of dimension 253 (about
                  1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample
                  the resulting probability distribution, which we
                  verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore
                  processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one
                  instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our
                  benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent
                  task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer
                  would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic
                  increase in speed compared to all known classical
                  algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum
                  supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task,
                  heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract  = {In 2009, Abdalla et al. proposed a reasonably
                  practical password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE)
                  secure against adaptive adversaries in the universal
                  composability (UC) framework. It exploited the
                  Canetti-Fischlin methodology for commitments and the
                  Cramer-Shoup smooth projective hash functions
                  (SPHFs), following the Gennaro-Lindell approach for
                  PAKE. In this paper, we revisit the notion of
                  non-interactive commitments, with a new formalism
                  that implies UC security. In addition, we provide a
                  quite efficient instantiation. We then extend our
                  formalism to SPHF-friendly commitments. We
                  thereafter show that it allows a blackbox
                  application to one-round PAKE and oblivious transfer
                  (OT), still secure in the UC framework against
                  adaptive adversaries, assuming reliable erasures and
                  a single global common reference string, even for
                  multiple sessions. Our instantiations are more
                  efficient than the Abdalla et al.  PAKE in Crypto
                  2009 and the recent OT protocol proposed by Choi et
                  al. in PKC 2013. Furthermore, the new PAKE
                  instantiation is the first one-round scheme
                  achieving UC security against adaptive adversaries.},

Our proof also applies to concatenation of higher-distance codes, and to noise models that allow faults to be correlated in space and in time. The proof uses new criteria for assessing the accuracy of fault-tolerant circuits, which are particularly conducive to the inductive analysis of recursive simulations. Our lower bound on the threshold, epsilon_0 > 2.73 \times 10^{-5} for an adversarial independent stochastic noise model, is derived from a computer-assisted combinatorial analysis; it is the best lower bound that has been rigorously proven so far.},

                  parties, using threshold fully homomorphic
                  encryption (TFHE). In such scheme, the parties
                  jointly generate a common FHE public key along with
                  a secret key that is shared among them; they can
                  later cooperatively decrypt ciphertexts without
                  learning anything but the plaintext. We show how to
                  instantiate this approach efficiently, by extending
                  the recent FHE schemes of Brakerski, Gentry and
                  Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO '11, FOCS '11, ITCS '12)
                  based on the (ring) learning with errors
                  assumption. Our main tool is to exploit the property

  abstract = {We propose a method for the stabilization of
                  quantum computations (including quantum state
                  storage). The method is based on the operation of
                  projection into \$\cal SYM\$, the symmetric subspace
                  of the full state space of R redundant copies of the
                  computer. We describe an efficient algorithm and
                  quantum network effecting \$\cal SYM\$--projection
                  and discuss the stabilizing effect of the proposed
                  method in the context of unitary errors generated by
                  hardware imprecision, and nonunitary errors arising
                  from external environmental interaction. Finally,
                  limitations of the method are discussed.},

                  computation. This is in contrast with the more

  abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial
                  speed-ups over their classical counterparts and to
                  solve problems intractable for classical
                  computers. Beyond such practical significance, the
                  concept of quantum computation opens up fundamental
                  questions, among them the issue of whether quantum
                  computations can be certified by entities that are
                  inherently unable to compute the results
                  themselves. Here we present the first experimental
                  verification of quantum computation. We show, in
                  theory and experiment, how a verifier with minimal
                  quantum resources can test a significantly more
                  powerful quantum computer. The new verification
                  protocol introduced here uses the framework of blind
                  quantum computing and is independent of the
                  experimental quantum-computation platform used. In
                  our scheme, the verifier is required only to
                  generate single qubits and transmit them to the
                  quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this
                  protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the
                  verifier can test the computer's ability to perform
                  quantum computation.},

                  functionality to a large class of (non-threshold)
                  cryptographic schemes. A threshold functionality
                  enables a secret key to be split into a number of
                  shares, so that only a threshold of parties can use
                  the key, without reconstructing the key. We begin by
                  constructing a threshold fully-homomorphic
                  encryption scheme (ThFHE) from the learning with
                  errors (LWE) problem. We next introduce a new
                  concept, called a universal thresholdizer, from
                  which many threshold systems are possible. We show
                  how to construct a universal thresholdizer from our
                  ThFHE. A universal thresholdizer can be used to add
                  threshold functionality to many systems, such as
                  CCA-secure public-key encryption (PKE), signature
                  schemes, pseudorandom functions, and others
                  primitives. In particular, by applying this paradigm
                  to a (non-threshold) lattice signature system, we
                  obtain the first single-round threshold signature
                  scheme from LWE.},

  abstract  = {Low-Density Parity-Check codes (LDPCC) with
                  Iterative Belief Propagation (Message Passing)
                  decoding are attractive alternatives to Turbo
                  codes. LDPCC previously discussed in the literature
                  have involved matrices constructed using random
                  techniques. In this paper, we discuss construction
                  techniques for LDPCC involving multiple permutation
                  matrices, each specified by a linear
                  congruence. Construction options depend on the size
                  of the parity-check matrix and the rate of the
                  code. We relate desirable properties of the code to
                  the parameters defining the linear congruences
                  specifying the permutation matrices used to
                  construct the code. For example, codes with few or
                  no 4-cycles can be readily constructed. We summarize
                  the construction options and describe selection
                  processes for the parameters of the congruences. We
                  then provide performance results for regular
                  parity-check matrices constructed by random and the
                  linear-congruence techniques for rate 1/2 transmit
                  block-size 980 and rate 4/7 transmit block-size 847
                  codes. We introduce a symmetric channel model for
                  decoding with the iterative belief propagation
                  algorithm and describe its use as a heuristic for
                  deciding whether a code is likely better or worse
                  than most codes of the given rate and block size.},

  abstract  = {Quantum computers, besides offering substantial
                  computational speedups, are also expected to
                  preserve the privacy of a computation. We present an
                  experimental demonstration of blind quantum
                  computing in which the input, computation, and
                  output all remain unknown to the computer. We
                  exploit the conceptual framework of
                  measurement-based quantum computation that enables a
                  client to delegate a computation to a quantum
                  server. Various blind delegated computations,
                  including one- and two-qubit gates and the Deutsch
                  and Grover quantum algorithms, are demonstrated. The
                  client only needs to be able to prepare and transmit
                  individual photonic qubits. Our demonstration is
                  crucial for unconditionally secure quantum cloud
                  computing and might become a key ingredient for
                  real-life applications, especially when considering
                  the challenges of making powerful quantum computers
                  widely available.},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;In this paper we analyze for the first time the post-quantum security of AES. AES is the most popular and widely used block cipher, established as the encryption standard by the NIST in 2001. We consider the secret key setting and, in particular, AES-256, the recommended primitive and one of the few existing ones that aims at providing a post-quantum security of 128 bits. In order to determine the new security margin, i.e., the lowest number of non-attacked rounds in time less than 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions, we first provide generalized and quantized versions of the best known cryptanalysis on reduced-round AES, as well as a discussion on attacks that don’t seem to benefit from a significant quantum speed-up. &lt;br&gt;We propose a new framework for structured search that encompasses both the classical and quantum attacks we present, and allows to efficiently compute their complexity. We believe this framework will be useful for future analysis.&lt;br&gt;Our best attack is a quantum Demirci-Selçuk meet-in-the-middle attack. Unexpectedly, using the ideas underlying its design principle also enables us to obtain new, counter-intuitive classical TMD trade-offs. In particular, we can reduce the memory in some attacks against AES-256 and AES-128.&lt;br&gt;One of the building blocks of our attacks is solving efficiently the AES S-Box differential equation, with respect to the quantum cost of a reversible S-Box. We believe that this generic quantum tool will be useful for future quantum differential attacks. Judging by the results obtained so far, AES seems a resistant primitive in the post-quantum world as well as in the classical one, with a bigger security margin with respect to quantum generic attacks.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

                  standard chosen message query model by allowing the
                  adversary to issue quantum chosen message queries:
                  given a superposition of messages, the adversary
                  receives a superposition of signatures on those
                  messages. Similarly, for encryption, we allow the

                  queries: given a superposition of ciphertexts, the
                  adversary receives a superposition of their
                  decryptions. These adversaries model a natural
                  ubiquitous quantum computing environment where

One is always positive, the other can be negative (nd compensate the positiviy of the other). => try to balance both. - Section 6.3 describes a situation where noise is approximately decomposable into detectable / undetectable components and makes partial analytic computation. -->},

  abstract  = {In a data-driven society, individuals and companies
                  encounter numerous situations where private
                  information is an important resource. How can
                  parties handle confidential data if they do not
                  trust everyone involved? This text is the first to
                  present a comprehensive treatment of unconditionally
                  secure techniques for multiparty computation (MPC)
                  and secret sharing. In a secure MPC, each party
                  possesses some private data, while secret sharing
                  provides a way for one party to spread information
                  on a secret such that all parties together hold full
                  information, yet no single party has all the
                  information. The authors present basic feasibility
                  results from the last 30 years, generalizations to
                  arbitrary access structures using linear secret
                  sharing, some recent techniques for efficiency
                  improvements, and a general treatment of the theory
                  of secret sharing, focusing on asymptotic results
                  with interesting applications related to MPC.},

                  functions based on the sponge construction. A
                  crucial property for hash functions in the
                  post-quantum setting is the collapsing property (a
                  strengthening of collision-resistance). We show that
                  the sponge construction is collapsing (and in
                  consequence quantum collision-resistant) under
                  suitable assumptions about the underlying block
                  function. In particular, if the block function is a
                  random function or a (non-invertible) random
                  permutation, the sponge construction is
                  collapsing. We also give a quantum algorithm for
                  finding collisions in an arbitrary function. For the
                  sponge construction, the algorithm complexity
                  asymptotically matches the complexity implied by
                  collision resistance.},

  abstract = {In order to bring quantum networks into the real
                  world, we would like to determine the requirements
                  of quantum network protocols including the
                  underlying quantum hardware. Because detailed
                  architecture proposals are generally too complex for
                  mathematical analysis, it is natural to employ
                  numerical simulation. Here we introduce NetSquid,
                  the NETwork Simulator for QUantum Information using
                  Discrete events, a discrete-event based platform for
                  simulating all aspects of quantum networks and
                  modular quantum computing systems, ranging from the
                  physical layer and its control plane up to the
                  application level. We study several use cases to
                  showcase NetSquid’s power, including detailed
                  physical layer simulations of repeater chains based

                  regime, and showcase NetSquid’s ability to
                  investigate large networks by simulating

                  construction for Hamiltonian Cycle remains secure
                  against quantum adversaries in the relativistic
                  setting. Our main technical contribution is a tool
                  for studying the action of consecutive measurements
                  on a quantum state which in turn gives upper bounds
                  on the value of some entangled games. This allows us
                  to prove the security of our protocol against
                  quantum adversaries. We also prove security bounds
                  for the (single-round) relativistic string
                  commitment and bit commitment in parallel against
                  quantum adversaries. As an additional consequence of
                  our result, we answer an open question from [Unr12]
                  and show tight bounds on the quantum knowledge error
                  of some {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varSigma

  abstract  = {Attacks on cryptographic protocols are usually
                  modeled by allowing an adversary to ask queries to
                  an oracle. Security is then defined by requiring
                  that as long as the queries satisfy some constraint,
                  there is some problem the adversary cannot solve,
                  such as compute a certain piece of information. Even
                  if the protocol is quantum, the queries are
                  typically classical. In this paper, we introduce a
                  new model of quantum attacks on protocols, where the
                  adversary is allowed quantum access to the
                  primitive, i.e., he may ask several classical
                  queries in quantum superposition. This is a strictly
                  stronger attack than the standard one, and we
                  consider the security of several primitives in this
                  model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is
                  secure with threshold {\$}{\$}t{\$}{\$}tin the
                  standard model is secure against superposition
                  attacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to
                  {\$}{\$}t/2{\$}{\$}t/2. This holds for all classical
                  as well as all known quantum secret sharing
                  schemes. We then consider zero- knowledge and first
                  show that known protocols are not, in general,
                  secure in our model by designing a superposition
                  attack on the well-known zero-knowledge protocol for
                  graph isomorphism. We then use our secret-sharing
                  result to design zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP
                  in the common reference string model. While our
                  protocol is classical, it is sound against a
                  cheating unbounded quantum prover and computational
                  zero-knowledge even if the verifier is allowed a
                  superposition attack. Finally, we consider
                  multiparty computation and give a characterization
                  of a class of protocols that can be shown secure,
                  though not necessarily with efficient simulation. We
                  show that this class contains non-trivial protocols
                  that cannot be shown secure by running a classical
                  simulator in superposition.},

                  ever/growing needs of personal computing power. For
                  delegated computation protocols to be usable in a
                  larger context -- or simply to securely run two
                  protocols in parallel -- the security definitions
                  need to be composable. Here, we define composable

                  distinguish between protocols which provide only
                  blindness -- the computation is hidden from the
                  server -- and those that are also verifiable -- the
                  client can check that it has received the correct
                  result. We show that the composable security
                  definition capturing both these notions can be
                  reduced to a combination of several distinct
                  ``trace/distance/type'' criteria -- which are,

  abstract  = {The cryptographic task of secure multi-party
                  (classical) computation has received a lot of
                  attention in the last decades. Even in the extreme
                  case where a computation is performed between k
                  mutually distrustful players, and security is
                  required even for the single honest player if all
                  other players are colluding adversaries, secure
                  protocols are known. For quantum computation, on the
                  other hand, protocols allowing arbitrary dishonest
                  majority have only been proven for
                  {\$}{\$}k=2{\$}{\$}. In this work, we generalize the
                  approach taken by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail
                  (CRYPTO 2012) in the two-party setting to devise a
                  secure, efficient protocol for multi-party quantum
                  computation for any number of players k, and prove
                  security against up to {\$}{\$}k-1{\$}{\$}colluding
                  adversaries. The quantum round complexity of the
                  protocol for computing a quantum circuit of
                  {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf
                  {\{}CNOT{\}}, {\backslash}mathsf {\{}T{\}}
                  {\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}depth d is {\$}{\$}O(k
                  {\backslash}cdot (d + {\backslash}log n)){\$}{\$},
                  where n is the security parameter. To achieve
                  efficiency, we develop a novel public verification
                  protocol for the Clifford authentication code, and a
                  testing protocol for magic-state inputs, both using
                  classical multi-party computation.},

                  secure in the presence of quantum adversaries. The
                  proof uses a recent result of Watrous [20] that
                  allows quantum rewinding for protocols of a certain
                  form. We then discuss two applications. First, the
                  combination of coin-flipping with any
                  non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol leads to an
                  easy transformation from non-interactive
                  zero-knowledge to interactive quantum
                  zero-knowledge. Second, we discuss how our protocol
                  can be applied to a recently proposed method for
                  improving the security of quantum protocols [4],
                  resulting in an implementation without set-up
                  assumptions. Finally, we sketch how to achieve
                  efficient simulation for an extended construction in
                  the common-reference-string model.},

                  description of the Rijndael structure and the steps
                  of its round transformation. Subsequently, we
                  specify the number of rounds as a function of the
                  block and key length, and describe the key
                  schedule. We conclude this chapter with a treatment

  abstract  = {We introduce a simulator of a quantum internet with
                  the specific goal to support software development. A
                  quantum internet consists of local quantum
                  processors, which are interconnected by quantum
                  communication channels that enable the transmission
                  of qubits between the different processors. While
                  many simulators exist for local quantum processors,
                  there is presently no simulator for a quantum
                  internet tailored towards software
                  development. Quantum internet protocols require both
                  classical as well as quantum information to be
                  exchanged between the network nodes, next to the
                  execution of gates and measurements on a local
                  quantum processor. This requires quantum internet
                  software to integrate classical communication
                  programming practises with novel quantum
                  ones. SimulaQron is built to enable application
                  development and explore software engineering
                  practises for a quantum internet. SimulaQron can be
                  run on one or more classical computers to simulate
                  local quantum processors, which are transparently
                  connected in the background to enable the
                  transmission of qubits or the generation of
                  entanglement between remote processors. Application
                  software can access the simulated local quantum
                  processors to execute local quantum instructions and
                  measurements, but also to transmit qubits to remote
                  nodes in the network. SimulaQron features a modular
                  design that performs a distributed simulation based
                  on any existing simulation of a quantum computer
                  capable of integrating with Python. Programming
                  libraries for Python and C are provided to
                  facilitate application development.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of quantum technologies,
                  a pressing need has emerged for a wide array of
                  tools for the certification and characterization of
                  quantum devices. Such tools are critical because the
                  powerful applications of quantum information science
                  will only be realized if stringent levels of
                  precision of components can be reached and their
                  functioning guaranteed. This Technical Review
                  provides a brief overview of the known
                  characterization methods for certification,
                  benchmarking and tomographic reconstruction of
                  quantum states and processes, and outlines their
                  applications in quantum computing, simulation and

                  quantum world. With this in mind, we study the
                  feasibility of realizing functionalities in the
                  framework of universal composability, with respect
                  to both computational and information-theoretic
                  security. With respect to computational security, we
                  show that existing feasibility results carry over
                  unchanged from the classical to the quantum world; a
                  functionality is ``trivial'' (i.e., can be realized
                  without setup) in the quantum world if and only if
                  it is trivial in the classical world. The same holds
                  with regard to functionalities that are complete
                  (i.e., can be used to realize arbitrary other
                  functionalities).},

  isbn      = {978-3-642-00457-5},
  abstract  = {We propose a general security definition for
                  cryptographic quantum protocols that implement
                  classical non-reactive two-party tasks. The
                  definition is expressed in terms of simple quantum-
                  information-theoretic conditions which must be
                  satisfied by the protocol to be secure. The
                  conditions are uniquely determined by the ideal
                  functionality {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}
                  defining the cryptographic task to be
                  implemented. We then show the following composition
                  result. If quantum protocols $\pi$ 1,...,$\pi$ ℓ
                  securely implement ideal functionalities
                  {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$}
                  according to our security definition, then any
                  purely classical two-party protocol, which makes
                  sequential calls to
                  {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$}
                  , is equally secure as the protocol obtained by
                  replacing the calls to
                  {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}1,{\backslash}ldots,{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\backslash}ell{\$}
                  with the respective quantum protocols $\pi$
                  1,...,$\pi$ ℓ. Hence, our approach yields the
                  minimal security requirements which are strong
                  enough for the typical use of quantum protocols as
                  subroutines within larger classical
                  schemes. Finally, we show that recently proposed
                  quantum protocols for secure identification and
                  oblivious transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage
                  model satisfy our security definition, and thus
                  compose in the above sense.},

  abstract  = {With experimental quantum computing technologies now
                  in their infancy, the search for efficient means of
                  testing the correctness of these quantum
                  computations is becoming more pressing. An approach
                  to the verification of quantum computation within
                  the framework of interactive proofs has been
                  fruitful for addressing this problem. Specifically,
                  an untrusted agent (prover) alleging to perform
                  quantum computations can have his claims verified by
                  another agent (verifier) who only has access to
                  classical computation and a small quantum device for
                  preparing or measuring single qubits. However, when
                  this quantum device is prone to errors, verification
                  becomes challenging and often existing protocols
                  address this by adding extra assumptions, such as
                  requiring the noise in the device to be uncorrelated
                  with the noise on the prover’s devices. In this
                  paper, we present a simple protocol for verifying
                  quantum computations, in the presence of noisy
                  devices, with no extra assumptions. This protocol is
                  based on post hoc techniques for verification, which
                  allow for the prover to know the desired quantum
                  computation and its input. We also perform a
                  simulation of the protocol, for a one-qubit
                  computation, and find the error thresholds when
                  using the qubit repetition code as well as the
                  Steane code.},

  abstract  = {At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the
                  study of quantum-secure encryption. They proposed
                  first indistinguishability definitions for the
                  quantum world where the actual indistinguishability
                  only holds for classical messages, and they provide
                  arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger
                  notion. In this work, we show that stronger notions
                  are achievable, where the indistinguishability holds
                  for quantum superpositions of messages. We
                  investigate exhaustively the possibilities and
                  subtle differences in defining such a quantum
                  indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key
                  encryption schemes. We justify our stronger
                  definition by showing its equivalence to novel
                  quantum semantic-security notions that we
                  introduce. Furthermore, we show that our new
                  security definitions cannot be achieved by a large
                  class of ciphers -- those which are quasi-preserving
                  the message length. On the other hand, we provide a
                  secure construction based on quantum-resistant
                  pseudorandom permutations; this construction can be
                  used as a generic transformation for turning a large
                  class of encryption schemes into quantum
                  indistinguishable and hence quantum semantically
                  secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first
                  completely classical encryption scheme shown to be
                  secure against an even stronger notion of
                  indistinguishability, which was previously known to
                  be achievable only by using quantum messages and
                  arbitrary quantum encryption circuits.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve not
                  only problems believed to be intractable for
                  classical computers, but also problems for which
                  verifying the solution is also considered
                  intractable. This raises the question of how one can
                  check whether quantum computers are indeed producing
                  correct results. This task, known as quantum
                  verification, has been highlighted as a significant
                  challenge on the road to scalable quantum computing
                  technology. We review the most significant
                  approaches to quantum verification and compare them
                  in terms of structure, complexity and required
                  resources. We also comment on the use of
                  cryptographic techniques which, for many of the
                  presented protocols, has proven extremely useful in
                  performing verification. Finally, we discuss issues
                  related to fault tolerance, experimental
                  implementations and the outlook for future
                  protocols.},

  title    = {Constructor Theory as Process Theory},
  year     = {2023},
  abstract = {Constructor theory is a meta-theoretic approach that seeks to characterise concrete theories of physics
in terms of the (im)possibility to implement certain abstract “tasks” by means of physical processes.
Process theory, on the other hand, pursues analogous characterisation goals in terms of the compo-
sitional structure of said processes, concretely presented through the lens of (symmetric monoidal)
category theory. In this work, we show how to formulate fundamental notions of constructor the-
ory within the canvas of process theory. Specifically, we exploit the functorial interplay between
the symmetric monoidal structure of the category of sets and relations, where the abstract tasks live,
and that of symmetric monoidal categories from physics, where concrete processes can be found to
implement said tasks. Through this, we answer the question of how constructor theory relates to the
broader body of process-theoretic literature, and provide the impetus for future collaborative work
between the fields},

  abstract  = {One of the main challenges in the field of quantum
                  simulation and computation is to identify ways to
                  certify the correct functioning of a device when a
                  classical efficient simulation is not
                  available. Important cases are situations in which
                  one cannot classically calculate local expectation
                  values of state preparations efficiently. In this
                  work, we develop weak-membership formulations of the
                  certification of ground state preparations. We
                  provide a non-interactive protocol for certifying
                  ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians based
                  on simple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian
                  terms. This certification protocol can be applied to
                  classically intractable analog quantum simulations:
                  For example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one
                  can encode universal quantum computation in such
                  ground states. Moreover, our certification protocol
                  is applicable to ground state encodings of IQP
                  circuits aiming at the demonstration of quantum
                  supremacy. These can be certified efficiently when
                  the error is polynomially bounded.},

  abstract  = {Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a
                  severe threat for public key cryptography. This
                  motivated the cryptographic community to search for
                  quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the
                  impact of quantum computing on secret key
                  cryptography is much less understood. In this paper,
                  we consider attacks where an adversary can query an
                  oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a
                  quantum superposition of different states. This
                  model gives a lot of power to the adversary, but
                  recent results show that it is nonetheless possible
                  to build secure cryptosystems in it.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in
                  the past few years. However, due to limitations in
                  the scalability of quantum technologies, it seems
                  that we are far from constructing universal quantum
                  computers for everyday users. A more feasible
                  solution is the delegation of computation to
                  powerful quantum servers on the network. This
                  solution was proposed in previous studies of blind
                  quantum computation, with guarantees for both the
                  secrecy of the input and of the computation being
                  performed. In this work, we further develop this
                  idea of computing over encrypted data, to propose a
                  multiparty delegated quantum computing protocol in
                  the measurement-based quantum computing
                  framework. We prove the security of the protocol
                  against a dishonest server and against dishonest
                  clients, under the assumption of common classical
                  cryptographic constructions.},

                  adversaries (FOCS 1986). In this paper, we provide a

                  in particular to the field of secure computation, to
                  the best of our knowledge, this is the first time

                  to building non-interactive arguments (of knowledge)
                  in the random oracle model. Unfortunately, existing
                  proof techniques are incapable of proving the
                  security of Fiat-Shamir in the quantum setting. The
                  problem stems from (1) the difficulty of quantum
                  rewinding, and (2) the inability of current
                  techniques to adaptively program random oracles in
                  the quantum setting. In this work, we show how to
                  overcome the limitations above in many settings. In
                  particular, we give mild conditions under which
                  Fiat-Shamir is secure in the quantum setting. As an
                  application, we show that existing lattice
                  signatures based on Fiat-Shamir are secure without
                  any modifications.},

                  is a new paradigm for defining the security of
                  cryptographic schemes such as symmetric encryption,
                  message authentication codes, public-key encryption,
                  key-agreement protocols, and digital signature
                  schemes, and for proving the security of protocols
                  making use of such schemes. Such a cryptographic
                  scheme can be seen (and defined) as constructing a
                  certain resource (e.g. a channel or key) with
                  certain security properties from another (weaker)
                  such resource. For example, a secure encryption
                  scheme constructs a secure channel from an
                  authenticated channel and a secret key.},

  abstract = {Multipartite entangled states are a fundamental
                  resource for a wide range of quantum information
                  processing tasks. In particular, in quantum
                  networks, it is essential for the parties involved
                  to be able to verify if entanglement is present
                  before they carry out a given distributed task. Here
                  we design and experimentally demonstrate a protocol
                  that allows any party in a network to check if a
                  source is distributing a genuinely multipartite
                  entangled state, even in the presence of untrusted
                  parties. The protocol remains secure against
                  dishonest behaviour of the source and other parties,
                  including the use of system imperfections to their
                  advantage. We demonstrate the verification protocol
                  in a three- and four-party setting using
                  polarization-entangled photons, highlighting its
                  potential for realistic photonic quantum
                  communication and networking applications.},

  abstract  = {We present an analysis of Wiesner's quantum money
                  scheme, as well as some natural generalizations of
                  it, based on semidefinite programming. For Wiesner's
                  original scheme, it is determined that the optimal
                  probability for a counterfeiter to create two copies
                  of a bank note from one, where both copies pass the
                  bank's test for validity, is (3/4)nfor n being the
                  number of qubits used for each note. Generalizations
                  in which other ensembles of states are substituted
                  for the one considered by Wiesner are also
                  discussed, including a scheme recently proposed by
                  Pastawski, Yao, Jiang, Lukin, and Cirac, as well as
                  schemes based on higher dimensional quantum
                  systems. In addition, we introduce a variant of
                  Wiesner's quantum money in which the verification
                  protocol for bank notes involves only classical
                  communication with the bank. We show that the
                  optimal probability with which a counterfeiter can
                  succeed in two independent verification attempts,
                  given access to a single valid n-qubit bank note, is
                  {\$}(3/4+{\backslash}sqrt{\{}2{\}}/8)^n{\$}. We also
                  analyze extensions of this variant to
                  higher-dimensional schemes.},

                  using a single ultracold 40Ca\&\#x002B; ion trapped

  abstract  = {A computer is generally considered to be a universal
                  computational device; i.e., it is believed able to
                  simulate any physical computational device with a
                  cost in computation time of at most a polynomial
                  factor: It is not clear whether this is still true
                  when quantum mechanics is taken into
                  consideration. Several researchers, starting with
                  David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum
                  mechanical computers and have investigated their
                  computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas
                  algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and
                  factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a
                  number of steps which is polynomial in the input
                  size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to
                  be factored. These two problems are generally
                  considered hard on a classical computer and have
                  been used as the basis of several proposed
                  cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of
                  quantum cryptanalysis.},

                  (FOCS 2001) allows for secure composition of
                  arbitrary protocols. We present a quantum version of
                  the UC model which enjoys the same compositionality
                  guarantees. We prove that in this model
                  statistically secure oblivious transfer protocols
                  can be constructed from commitments. Furthermore, we
                  show that every statistically classically UC secure
                  protocol is also statistically quantum UC
                  secure. Such implications are not known for other
                  quantum security definitions. As a corollary, we get
                  that quantum UC secure protocols for general
                  multi-party computation can be constructed from
                  commitments.},

  abstract       = {Recent advances in theoretical and experimental
                  quantum computing raise the problem of verifying the
                  outcome of these quantum computations. The recent
                  verification protocols using blind quantum computing
                  are fruitful for addressing this
                  problem. Unfortunately, all known schemes have
                  relatively high overhead. Here we present a novel
                  construction for the resource state of verifiable
                  blind quantum computation. This approach achieves a
                  better verifiability of 0.866 in the case of
                  classical output. In addition, the number of
                  required qubits is 2N+4cN, where N and c are the
                  number of vertices and the maximal degree in the
                  original computation graph, respectively. In other
                  words, our overhead is less linear in the size of

  abstract  = {We propose a complexity model of quantum circuits
                  analogous to the standard (acyclic) Boolean circuit
                  model. It is shown that any function computable in
                  polynomial time by a quantum Turing machine has a
                  polynomial-size quantum circuit. This result also
                  enables us to construct a universal quantum computer
                  which can simulate, with a polynomial factor
                  slowdown, a broader class of quantum machines than
                  that considered by E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani
                  (1993), thus answering an open question raised by
                  them. We also develop a theory of quantum
                  communication complexity, and use it as a tool to
                  prove that the majority function does not have a
                  linear-size quantum formula.<>},

  abstract      = {This book is an introduction to quantum Markov chains and explains how this concept is connected to the question of how well a lost quantum mechanical system can be recovered from a correlated subsystem. To achieve this goal, we strengthen the data-processing inequality such that it reveals a statement about the reconstruction of lost information. The main difficulty in order to understand the behavior of quantum Markov chains arises from the fact that quantum mechanical operators do not commute in general. As a result we start by explaining two techniques of how to deal with non-commuting matrices: the spectral pinching method and complex interpolation theory. Once the reader is familiar with these techniques a novel inequality is presented that extends the celebrated Golden-Thompson inequality to arbitrarily many matrices. This inequality is the key ingredient in understanding approximate quantum Markov chains and it answers a question from matrix analysis that was open since 1973, i.e., if Lieb's triple matrix inequality can be extended to more than three matrices. Finally, we carefully discuss the properties of approximate quantum Markov chains and their implications.},

More specifically, we show that in a client-server scenario, where the client holds the encryption key for an encrypted quantum register held by the server, it is possible for the server to perform a universal set of quantum gates on the quantum data. All Clifford group gates are non-interactive, while the remaining non-Clifford group gate that we implement (the p/8 gate) requires the client to prepare and send a single random auxiliary qubit (chosen among four possibilities), and exchange classical communication. This construction improves on previous work, which requires either multiple auxiliary qubits or two-way quantum communication. Using a reduction to an entanglement-based protocol, we show privacy against any adversarial server according to a simulation-based security definition.},

Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers - the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

Topologically protected quantum gates are realized by choosing appropriate boundary conditions on the cluster. We provide equivalence transformations for these boundary conditions that can be used to simplify fault-tolerant circuits and to derive circuit identities in a topological manner. The spatial dimensionality of the scheme can be reduced to two by converting one spatial axis of the cluster into time. The error threshold is 0.75% for each source in an error model with preparation, gate, storage and measurement errors. The operational overhead is poly-logarithmic in the circuit size.},

In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here.

  abstract      = {Lattice-based cryptography is one of the leading proposals for post-quantum cryptography. The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is arguably the most important problem for the cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryptography, and many lattice-based schemes have security claims based on its hardness. The best quantum algorithm for the SVP is due to Laarhoven [Laa16 PhD] and runs in (heuristic) time $2^{0.2653d + o(d)}$. In this article, we present an improvement over Laarhoven's result and present an algorithm that has a (heuristic) running time of $2^{0.2570 d + o(d)}$ where $d$ is the lattice dimension. We also present time-memory trade-offs where we quantify the amount of quantum memory and quantum random access memory of our algorithm. The core idea is to replace Grover's algorithm used in [Laa16 PhD] in a key part of the sieving algorithm by a quantum random walk in which we add a layer of local sensitive filtering.},

  year         = {2022},
  abstract     = {Given a random function $f$ with domain $[2^n]$ and codomain $[2^m]$, with $m \geq n$, a collision of $f$ is a pair of distinct inputs with the same image. Collision finding is an ubiquitous problem in cryptanalysis, and it has been well studied using both classical and quantum algorithms. Indeed, the quantum query complexity of the problem is well known to be $\Theta(2^{m/3})$, and matching algorithms are known for any value of $m$.

The situation becomes different when one is looking for multiple collision pairs. Here, for $2^k$ collisions, a query lower bound of $\Theta(2^{(2k+m)/3})$ was shown by Liu and Zhandry (EUROCRYPT 2019). A matching algorithm is known, but only for relatively small values of $m$, when many collisions exist. In this paper, we improve the algorithms for this problem and, in particular, extend the range of admissible parameters where the lower bound is met.

Our new method relies on a chained quantum walk algorithm, which might be of independent interest. It allows to extract multiple solutions of an MNRS-style quantum walk, without having to recompute it entirely: after finding and outputting a solution, the current state is reused as the initial state of another walk.

As an application, we improve the quantum sieving algorithms for the shortest vector problem (SVP), with a complexity of $2^{0.2563d + o(d)}$ instead of the previous $2^{0.2570d + o(d)}$.},

The main new idea is to apply quantum phase estimation to the quantum walk in order to implement an approximate reflection operator. This operator is then used in an amplitude amplification scheme. As a result we considerably expand the scope of the previous approaches of Ambainis (2004) and Szegedy (2004). Our algorithm combines the benefits of these approaches in terms of being able to find marked elements, incurring the smaller cost of the two, and being applicable to a larger class of Markov chains. In addition, it is conceptually simple and avoids some technical difficulties in the previous analyses of several algorithms based on quantum walk.},

The Asymptotic Equipartition Property implies that this is indeed the case to first order in $n$, under the assumption that the parts $A_i$ are identical and independent of each other. Here we show that entropy accumulation occurs more generally, i.e., without an independence assumption, provided one quantifies the uncertainty about the individual systems $A_i$ by the von Neumann entropy of suitably chosen conditional states. The analysis of a large system can hence be reduced to the study of its parts. This is relevant for applications. In device-independent cryptography, for instance, the approach yields essentially optimal security bounds valid for general attacks, as shown by Arnon-Friedman et al.},

This is a generalisation of the entropy accumulation theorem (EAT), which deals with a more restrictive model of side information: there, past side information cannot be updated in subsequent rounds, and newly generated side information has to satisfy a Markov condition. Due to its more general model of side-information, our generalised EAT can be applied more easily and to a broader range of cryptographic protocols. As examples, we give the first multi-round security proof for blind randomness expansion and a simplified analysis of the E91 QKD protocol. The proof of our generalised EAT relies on a new variant of Uhlmann's theorem and new chain rules for the Renyi divergence and entropy, which might be of independent interest.},

This breakthrough result was established by Mochon in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114]. However, his proof relied on the existence of certain unitary operators which was established by a non-constructive argument. Consequently, explicit protocols have remained elusive. In this work, we give exact constructions of related unitary operators. These, together with a new formalism, yield a family of protocols approaching perfect security thereby also simplifying Mochon's proof of existence. We illustrate the construction of explicit weak coin flipping protocols by considering concrete examples (from the aforementioned family of protocols) that are more secure than all previously known protocols.},

A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias $\epsilon$ if neither player can force the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than $\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$. While it is known that all classical protocols have $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$, Mochon showed in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114] that quantumly weak coin flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias (near perfect) but the best known explicit protocol has bias $1/6$ (also due to Mochon, 2005 [Phys. Rev. A 72, 022341]). We propose a framework to construct new explicit protocols achieving biases below $1/6$. In particular, we construct explicit unitaries for protocols with bias approaching $1/10$. To go below, we introduce what we call the Elliptic Monotone Align (EMA) algorithm which, together with the framework, allows us to numerically construct protocols with arbitrarily small biases.},

In order to develop these methods, we study the quantum weak coin flipping problem from both an algebraic and a geometric perspective. We also analytically construct illustrative examples of weak coin flipping protocols achieving different levels of security.},

  abstract      = {We call quantum security the area of IT security dealing with scenarios where one or more parties have access to quantum hardware. This encompasses both the fields of post-quantum cryptography (that is, traditional cryptography engineered to be resistant against quantum adversaries), and quantum cryptography (that is, security protocols designed to be natively run on a quantum infrastructure, such as quantum key distribution). In this work, we propose the first systematic classification of quantum security scenarios, and for each of them we recall the main tools and results, as well as presenting new ones. We achieve this goal by identifying four distinct quantum security classes, or domains, each of them encompassing the security notions and constructions related to a particular scenario. We start with the class QS0, which is `classical cryptography' (meaning that no quantum scenario is considered). Regarding post-quantum cryptography, we introduce the class QS1, where we discuss in detail the problems arising when designing a classical cryptographic object meant to be resistant against adversaries with local quantum computing power, and we provide a classification of the possible quantum security reductions in this scenario when considering provable security. In respect to hybrid classical-quantum models, in the security class QS2 we discuss in detail the possible scenarios where these scenarios arise, and what a correct formalization should be in terms of quantum oracle access. Finally, in the class QS3 we consider all those cryptographic constructions designed to run natively on quantum hardware. We believe that the framework we introduce in this work will be a valuable tool for the scientific community in addressing the challenges arising when formalizing sound constructions and notions of security in the quantum world.},

We characterize and quantify the genuine multi-particle entanglement of such graph states in terms of the Schmidt measure, to which we provide upper and lower bounds in graph theoretical terms. Several examples and classes of graphs will be discussed, where these bounds coincide. These examples include trees, cluster states of different dimension, graphs that occur in quantum error correction, such as the concatenated [7,1,3]-CSS code, and a graph associated with the quantum Fourier transform in the one-way computer. We also present general transformation rules for graphs when local Pauli measurements are applied, and give criteria for the equivalence of two graphs up to local unitary transformations, employing the stabilizer formalism. For graphs of up to seven vertices we provide complete characterization modulo local unitary transformations and graph isomorphies.},

Here, we give the first circuit-extraction algorithm to work for one-way computations containing measurements in all three planes and having gflow. The algorithm is efficient and the resulting circuits do not contain ancillae. One-way computations are represented using the ZX-calculus, hence the algorithm also represents the most general known procedure for extracting circuits from ZX-diagrams. In developing this algorithm, we generalise several concepts and results previously known for computations containing only XY-plane measurements. We bring together several known rewrite rules for measurement patterns and formalise them in a unified notation using the ZX-calculus. These rules are used to simplify measurement patterns by reducing the number of qubits while preserving both the semantics and the existence of gflow. The results can be applied to circuit optimisation by translating circuits to patterns and back again.},

There are many different quantum circuit decompositions for the same algorithm but it is desirable to compile leaner circuits. A fundamentally important cost metric is the $T$ count -- the number of $T$ gates in a circuit. For the single qubit case, optimal compiling is essentially a solved problem. However, multi-qubit compiling is a harder problem with optimal algorithms requiring classical runtime exponential in the number of qubits. Here, we present and compare several efficient quantum compilers for multi-qubit Clifford + $T$ circuits. We implemented our compilers in C++ and benchmarked them on random circuits, from which we determine that our TODD compiler yields the lowest $T$ counts on average. We also benchmarked TODD on a library of reversible logic circuits that appear in quantum algorithms and found that it reduced the $T$ count for 97\% of the circuits with an average $T$-count saving of 20\% when compared against the best of all previous circuit decompositions.},

  abstract      = {Bell non-locality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics whereby measurements performed on "spatially separated" quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be understood as revealing predetermined values. This is a special case of the more general phenomenon of "quantum contextuality", which says that such correlations can occur even when the measurements are not necessarily on separate quantum systems, but are merely "compatible" (i.e. commuting). Crucially, while any non-local game yields an experiment that demonstrates quantum advantage by leveraging the "spatial separation" of two or more devices (and in fact several such demonstrations have been conducted successfully in recent years), the same is not true for quantum contextuality: finding the contextuality analogue of such an experiment is arguably one of the central open questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In this work, we show that an arbitrary contextuality game can be compiled into an operational "test of contextuality" involving a single quantum device, by only making the assumption that the device is computationally bounded. Our work is inspired by the recent work of Kalai et al. (STOC '23) that converts any non-local game into a classical test of quantum advantage with a single device. The central idea in their work is to use cryptography to enforce spatial separation within subsystems of a single quantum device. Our work can be seen as using cryptography to enforce "temporal separation", i.e. to restrict communication between sequential measurements. Beyond contextuality, we employ our ideas to design a "proof of quantumness" that, to the best of our knowledge, is arguably even simpler than the ones proposed in the literature so far.},

Our protocol is secure assuming the post-quantum security of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and Learning with Errors (LWE). This is the first succinct argument for quantum computation in the plain model; prior work (Chia-Chung-Yamakawa, TCC '20) requires both a long common reference string and non-black-box use of a hash function modeled as a random oracle. At a technical level, we revisit the framework for constructing classically verifiable quantum computation (Mahadev, FOCS '18). We give a self-contained, modular proof of security for Mahadev's protocol, which we believe is of independent interest. Our proof readily generalizes to a setting in which the verifier's first message (which consists of many public keys) is compressed. Next, we formalize this notion of compressed public keys; we view the object as a generalization of constrained/programmable PRFs and instantiate it based on indistinguishability obfuscation. Finally, we compile the above protocol into a fully succinct argument using a (sufficiently composable) succinct argument of knowledge for NP. Using our framework, we achieve several additional results, including - Succinct arguments for QMA (given multiple copies of the witness), - Succinct non-interactive arguments for BQP (or QMA) in the quantum random oracle model, and - Succinct batch arguments for BQP (or QMA) assuming post-quantum LWE (without iO).},

Existing information theoretically Secure Delegated Quantum Computing (SDQC) protocols require the client to possess the ability to perform either trusted state preparations or measurements. Whether it is possible to verify universal quantum computations with information-theoretic security without trusted preparations or measurements was an open question so far. In this paper, we settle this question in the affirmative by presenting a modular, composable, and efficient way to turn known verification schemes into protocols that rely only on trusted gates. Our first contribution is an extremely lightweight reduction of the problem of quantum verification for BQP to the trusted application of single-qubit rotations around the Z axis and bit flips. The second construction presented in this work shows that it is generally possible to information-theoretically verify arbitrary quantum computations with quantum output without trusted preparations or measurements. However, this second protocol requires the verifier to perform multi-qubit gates on a register whose size is independent of the size of the delegated computation.},

  abstract     = {By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are otherwise impossible classically.
Two most notable examples of unclonable cryptography are quantum copy-protection and unclonable encryption.
Most known constructions rely on the quantum random oracle model (as opposed to the plain model), in which all parties have access in superposition to a powerful random oracle.
Despite receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions still remain: copy-protection for point functions in the plain model, which is usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and unclonable encryption with unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model.
A core ingredient of these protocols is the so-called monogamy-of-entanglement property.
Such games allow quantifying the correlations between the outcomes of multiple non-communicating parties sharing entanglement in a particular context.
Specifically, we define the games between a challenger and three players in which the first player is asked to split and share a quantum state between the two others, who are then simultaneously asked a question and need to output the correct answer.

In this work, by relying on previous works of Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry (Crypto&#39;21) and Culf and Vidick (Quantum&#39;22), we establish a new monogamy-of-entanglement property for subspace coset states, which allows us to progress towards the aforementioned goals.

However, it is not sufficient on its own, and we present two conjectures that would allow first to show that copy-protection of point functions exists in the plain model, with different challenge distributions (including arguably the most natural ones), and then that unclonable encryption with unclonable indistinguishability security exists in the plain model.

We believe that our new monogamy-of-entanglement to be of independent interest, and it could be useful in other applications as well.
To highlight this last point, we leverage our new monogamy-of-entanglement property to show the existence of a tokenized signature scheme with a new security definition, called unclonable unforgeability.},

In this work, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of $n$-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble, which is constructed from $(n+m)$-qubit Haar random states with $m$ qubits traced out. For a mixedness parameter $m=0$, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for $m=\omega(\log n)$, PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. In contrast to PRSs, PRDMs with $m=\omega(\log n)$ are robust to unital noise channels and a recently introduced $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ attack. Further, we construct pseudomagic and pseudocoherent state ensembles, which possess near-maximal magic and coherence, but are computationally indistinguishable from states with zero magic and coherence. PRDMs can exhibit a pseudoresource gap of $\Theta(n)$ vs $0$, surpassing previously found gaps. We introduce noise-robust EFI pairs, which are state ensembles that are computationally indistinguishable yet statistically far, even when subject to noise. We show that testing entanglement, magic and coherence is not efficient. Further, we prove that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.},

  abstract      = {Suppose we want to implement a unitary $U$, for instance a circuit for some quantum algorithm. Suppose our actual implementation is a unitary $\tilde{U}$, which we can only apply as a black-box. In general it is an exponentially-hard task to decide whether $\tilde{U}$ equals the intended $U$, or is significantly different in a worst-case norm. In this paper we consider two special cases where relatively efficient and lightweight procedures exist for this task. First, we give an efficient procedure under the assumption that $U$ and $\tilde{U}$ (both of which we can now apply as a black-box) are either equal, or differ significantly in only one $k$-qubit gate, where $k=O(1)$ (the $k$ qubits need not be contiguous). Second, we give an even more lightweight procedure under the assumption that $U$ and $\tilde{U}$ are Clifford circuits which are either equal, or different in arbitrary ways (the specification of $U$ is now classically given while $\tilde{U}$ can still only be applied as a black-box). Both procedures only need to run $\tilde{U}$ a constant number of times to detect a constant error in a worst-case norm. We note that the Clifford result also follows from earlier work of Flammia and Liu, and da Silva, Landon-Cardinal, and Poulin. In the Clifford case, our error-detection procedure also allows us efficiently to learn (and hence correct) $\tilde{U}$ if we have a small list of possible errors that could have happened to $U$; for example if we know that only $O(1)$ of the gates of $\tilde{U}$ are wrong, this list will be polynomially small and we can test each possible erroneous version of $U$ for equality with $\tilde{U}$.},

Generally, many-qubit entangled states are often used to complete BQC tasks. But for a large-scale entangled state, it is difficult to be described since its Hilbert space dimension is increasing exponentially. Furthermore, the number of entangled qubits is limited in experiment of existing works. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a universal BQC protocol based on measurement with minor resources, where the trap technology is adopted to verify correctness of the server's measurement outcomes during computation and testing process. In our model there are two participants, a client who prepares initial single-qubit states and a server that performs universal quantum computation. The client is almost classical since she does not require any quantum computational power, quantum memory. To realize the client's universal BQC, we construct an $m\times n$ latticed state composed of six-qubit cluster states and eight-qubit cluster states, which needs less qubits than the brickwork state. Finally, we analyze and prove the blindness, correctness, universality and verifiability of our proposed BQC protocol.},

It is vitally useful both in real experiments and in classical quantum simulations. Minimising the size of the twirling gate set increases the efficiency of simulations and in experiments it might reduce both the number of runs required and the circuit depth (and hence the error burden). Conventional twirling uses the full set of Pauli gates as the set of twirling gates. This article provides a theoretical background for Pauli twirling and a way to construct a twirling gate set with a number of members comparable to the size of the Pauli basis of the given error channel, which is usually much smaller than the full set of Pauli gates. We also show that twirling is equivalent to stabiliser measurements with discarded measurement results, which enables us to further reduce the size of the twirling gate set.},

We also consider the approximate case by providing lower bounds for the induced trace distance between the above operations and $n$ Hadamard gates. To demonstrate the stability of this result, this is then extended to a similar no-go result for the case of using $k$ Hadamard gates to exactly implement $n>k$ Hadamard gates.},

Our framework combines robust fidelity witnesses with efficient classical post-processing to implement measurement back-propagation. We demonstrate its usefulness by focusing on the verification of bosonic quantum systems, and developing efficient verification protocols for large classes of target states using the two most common types of Gaussian measurements: homodyne and heterodyne detection. Our protocols are semi-device independent, designed to function with minimal assumptions about the quantum device being tested, and offer practical improvements over previous existing approaches. Overall, our work introduces efficient methods for verifying the correct preparation of complex quantum states, and has consequences for calibrating large quantum devices, witnessing quantum properties, supporting demonstrations of quantum computational speedups and enhancing trust in quantum computations.},

For pure target states, we use functional representations that can be measured directly and determine the number of copies of the prepared state needed for fidelity estimation. In continuous variable (CV) systems, we utilise the Wigner function, which can be measured via displaced parity measurements. We provide upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity required for fidelity estimation, considering the worst-case scenario across all possible prepared states. For target states of particular interest, such as Fock and Gaussian states, we find that this sample complexity is characterised by the $L^1$-norm of the Wigner function, a measure of Wigner negativity widely studied in the literature, in particular in resource theories of quantum computation. For discrete variable systems consisting of $n$ qubits, we explore fidelity estimation protocols using Pauli string measurements. Similarly to the CV approach, the sample complexity is shown to be characterised by the $L^1$-norm of the characteristic function of the target state for both Haar random states and stabiliser states. Furthermore, in a general black box model, we prove that, for any target state, the optimal sample complexity for fidelity estimation is characterised by the smoothed $L^1$-norm of the target state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the $L^1$-norm of the Wigner function provides a lower bound on the cost of some information processing task.},

For complicated observables such as molecular electronic Hamiltonians, a common strategy is to present the observable as a linear combination of measurable fragments. The main problem of this approach is a large number of measurements required for accurate sampling of the observable's expectation value. We consider several partitioning schemes based on grouping of commuting multi-qubit Pauli products with the goal of minimizing the number of measurements. Three main directions are explored: 1) grouping commuting operators using the greedy approach, 2) involving non-local unitary transformations for measuring, and 3) taking advantage of compatibility of some Pauli products with several measurable groups. The last direction gives rise to a general framework that not only provides improvements over previous methods but also connects measurement grouping approaches with recent advances in techniques of shadow tomography. Following this direction, we develop two new measurement schemes that achieve a severalfold reduction in the number of measurements for a set of model molecules compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract      = {The accurate estimation of quantum observables is a critical task in science. With progress on the hardware, measuring a quantum system will become increasingly demanding, particularly for variational protocols that require extensive sampling. Here, we introduce a measurement scheme that adaptively modifies the estimator based on previously obtained data. Our algorithm, which we call AEQuO, continuously monitors both the estimated average and the associated error of the considered observable, and determines the next measurement step based on this information. We allow both for overlap and non-bitwise commutation relations in the subsets of Pauli operators that are simultaneously probed, thereby maximizing the amount of gathered information. AEQuO comes in two variants: a greedy bucket-filling algorithm with good performance for small problem instances, and a machine learning-based algorithm with more favorable scaling for larger instances. The measurement configuration determined by these subroutines is further post-processed in order to lower the error on the estimator. We test our protocol on chemistry Hamiltonians, for which AEQuO provides error estimates that improve on all state-of-the-art methods based on various grouping techniques or randomized measurements, thus greatly lowering the toll of measurements in current and future quantum applications.},

Starting with randomized measurements, we propose an efficient derandomization procedure that iteratively replaces random single-qubit measurements with fixed Pauli measurements; the resulting deterministic measurement procedure is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the randomized one. In particular, for estimating any $L$ low-weight Pauli observables, a deterministic measurement on only of order $\log(L)$ copies of a quantum state suffices. In some cases, for example when some of the Pauli observables have a high weight, the derandomized procedure is substantially better than the randomized one. Specifically, numerical experiments highlight the advantages of our derandomized protocol over various previous methods for estimating the ground-state energies of small molecules.},

  abstract      = {Solving the electronic structure problem using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique involves measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation value. Current hardware can perform only projective single-qubit measurements, and thus, the Hamiltonian expectation value is obtained by measuring parts of the Hamiltonian rather than the full Hamiltonian. This restriction makes the measurement process inefficient because the number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows as $O(N^4)$ with the size of the system, $N$. To optimize VQE measurement one can try to group as many Hamiltonian terms as possible for their simultaneous measurement. Single-qubit measurements allow one to group only the terms that commute within corresponding single-qubit subspaces or qubit-wise commuting. We found that qubit-wise commutativity between the Hamiltonian terms can be expressed as a graph and the problem of the optimal grouping is equivalent of finding a minimum clique cover (MCC) for the Hamiltonian graph. The MCC problem is NP-hard but there exist several polynomial heuristic algorithms to solve it approximately. Several of these heuristics were tested in this work for a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians. On average, grouping qubit-wise commuting terms reduced the number of operators to measure three times compared to the total number of terms in the considered Hamiltonians.},

  abstract      = {Estimating the expectation value of an operator corresponding to an observable is a fundamental task in quantum computation. It is often impossible to obtain such estimates directly, as the computer is restricted to measuring in a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the operator into a weighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of many measurements. An improved version collects mutually commuting Pauli operators together before measuring all operators within a collection simultaneously. The effectiveness of doing this depends on two factors. Firstly, we must understand the improvement offered by a given arrangement of Paulis in collections. In our work, we propose two natural metrics for quantifying this, operating under the assumption that measurements are distributed optimally among collections so as to minimise the overall finite sampling error. Motivated by the mathematical form of these metrics, we introduce SORTED INSERTION, a collecting strategy that exploits the weighting of each Pauli operator in the overall sum. Secondly, to measure all Pauli operators within a collection simultaneously, a circuit is required to rotate them to the computational basis. In our work, we present two efficient circuit constructions that suitably rotate any collection of $k$ independent commuting $n$-qubit Pauli operators using at most $kn-k(k+1)/2$ and $O(kn/\log k)$ two-qubit gates respectively. Our methods are numerically illustrated in the context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, where the operators in question are molecular Hamiltonians. As measured by our metrics, SORTED INSERTION outperforms four conventional greedy colouring algorithms that seek the minimum number of collections.},

  abstract      = {Aaronson, Atia, and Susskind established that swapping quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ is computationally equivalent to distinguishing their superpositions $|\psi\rangle\pm|\phi\rangle$. We extend this to a general duality principle: manipulating quantum states in one basis is equivalent to extracting values in a complementary basis. Formally, for any group, implementing a unitary representation is equivalent to Fourier subspace extraction from its irreducible representations. Building on this duality principle, we present the applications: * Quantum money, representing verifiable but unclonable quantum states, and its stronger variant, quantum lightning, have resisted secure plain-model constructions. While (public-key) quantum money has been constructed securely only from the strong assumption of quantum-secure iO, quantum lightning has lacked such a construction, with past attempts using broken assumptions. We present the first secure quantum lightning construction based on a plausible cryptographic assumption by extending Zhandry's construction from Abelian to non-Abelian group actions, eliminating reliance on a black-box model. Our construction is realizable with symmetric group actions, including those implicit in the McEliece cryptosystem. * We give an alternative quantum lightning construction from one-way homomorphisms, with security holding under certain conditions. This scheme shows equivalence among four security notions: quantum lightning security, worst-case and average-case cloning security, and security against preparing a canonical state. * Quantum fire describes states that are clonable but not telegraphable: they cannot be efficiently encoded classically. These states "spread" like fire, but are viable only in coherent quantum form. The only prior construction required a unitary oracle; we propose the first candidate in the plain model.},

They are known to be equivalent, in the sense that a collection of quantum states is telegraphable if and only if it is clonable. Our main result suggests that this is not the case when computational efficiency is considered. We give a collection of quantum states and quantum oracles relative to which these states are efficiently clonable but not efficiently telegraphable. Given that the opposite scenario is impossible (states that can be telegraphed can always trivially be cloned), this gives the most complete quantum oracle separation possible between these two important no-go properties. We additionally study the complexity class clonableQMA, a subset of QMA whose witnesses are efficiently clonable. As a consequence of our main result, we give a quantum oracle separation between clonableQMA and the class QCMA, whose witnesses are restricted to classical strings. We also propose a candidate oracle-free promise problem separating these classes. We finally demonstrate an application of clonable-but-not-telegraphable states to cryptography, by showing how such states can be used to protect against key exfiltration.},

  abstract      = {When is decoherence "effectively irreversible"? Here we examine this central question of quantum foundations using the tools of quantum computational complexity. We prove that, if one had a quantum circuit to determine if a system was in an equal superposition of two orthogonal states (for example, the $|$Alive$\rangle$ and $|$Dead$\rangle$ states of Schr\"{o}dinger's cat), then with only a slightly larger circuit, one could also $\mathit{swap}$ the two states (e.g., bring a dead cat back to life). In other words, observing interference between the $|$Alive$\rangle$and $|$Dead$\rangle$ states is a "necromancy-hard" problem, technologically infeasible in any world where death is permanent. As for the converse statement (i.e., ability to swap implies ability to detect interference), we show that it holds modulo a single exception, involving unitaries that (for example) map $|$Alive$\rangle$ to $|$Dead$\rangle$ but $|$Dead$\rangle$ to -$|$Alive$\rangle$. We also show that these statements are robust---i.e., even a $\mathit{partial}$ ability to observe interference implies partial swapping ability, and vice versa. Finally, without relying on any unproved complexity conjectures, we show that all of these results are quantitatively tight. Our results have possible implications for the state dependence of observables in quantum gravity, the subject that originally motivated this study.},

However, Wiesner's scheme required a central bank to verify the money, and the question of whether there can be unclonable quantum money that anyone can verify has remained open since. One can also ask a related question, which seems to be new: can quantum states be used as copy-protected programs, which let the user evaluate some function f, but not create more programs for f? This paper tackles both questions using the arsenal of modern computational complexity. Our main result is that there exist quantum oracles relative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money is possible, and any family of functions that cannot be efficiently learned from its input-output behavior can be quantumly copy-protected. This provides the first formal evidence that these tasks are achievable. The technical core of our result is a "Complexity-Theoretic No-Cloning Theorem," which generalizes both the standard No-Cloning Theorem and the optimality of Grover search, and might be of independent interest. Our security argument also requires explicit constructions of quantum t-designs. Moving beyond the oracle world, we also present an explicit candidate scheme for publicly-verifiable quantum money, based on random stabilizer states; as well as two explicit schemes for copy-protecting the family of point functions. We do not know how to base the security of these schemes on any existing cryptographic assumption. (Note that without an oracle, we can only hope for security under some computational assumption.)},

A consequence of this result is that the public-key quantum money scheme proposed by Zhandry (2024), based on abelian group actions, is secure in the generic group action model. Specifically, our result shows that breaking the quantum money scheme is equivalent, under quantum polynomial-time reductions, to solving the group action DLP. Two immediate implications of our results are: i) A separation between quantum money and quantum lightning. This separation arises because our reduction is non-uniform, and quantum lightning is not secure against non-uniform adversaries. ii) Cloning vs. preparing Fourier states. Our main theorem shows that the problem of cloning group action Fourier states is equivalent to the problem of preparing these states.},

There are two distinct wide-spread versions of generic groups, Shoup&#39;s and Maurer&#39;s, the main difference being whether or not group elements are given explicit labels. The two models are often treated as equivalent. In this work, however, we demonstrate that the models are in fact quite different, and care is needed when stating generic group results:

- We show that numerous textbook constructions are *not* captured by Maurer, but are captured by Shoup. In the other direction, any construction captured by Maurer *is* captured by Shoup.

- For constructions that exist in both models, we show that security is equivalent for &#34;single stage&#34; games, but Shoup security is strictly stronger than Maurer security for some &#34;multi-stage&#34; games.

- The existing generic group un-instantiability results do not apply to Maurer. We fill this gap with a new un-instantiability result.

- We explain how the known black box separations between generic groups and identity-based encryption do not fully apply to Shoup, and resolve this by providing such a separation.

- We give a new un-instantiability result for the *algebraic* group model.},

  abstract     = {Isogeny-based assumptions have emerged as a viable option for quantum-secure cryptography. Recent works have
shown how to build efficient (public-key) primitives from isogeny-based assumptions such as CSIDH and CSI-FiSh.
However, in its present form, the landscape of isogenies does not seem very amenable to realizing new cryptographic
applications. Isogeny-based assumptions often have unique efficiency and security properties, which makes building
new cryptographic applications from them a potentially tedious and time-consuming task.


In this work, we propose a new framework based on group actions that enables the easy usage of a variety of
isogeny-based assumptions. Our framework generalizes the works of Brassard and Yung (Crypto’90) and Couveignes
(Eprint’06). We provide new definitions for group actions endowed with natural hardness assumptions that model
isogeny-based constructions amenable to group actions such as CSIDH and CSI-FiSh.


We demonstrate the utility of our new framework by leveraging it to construct several primitives that were not
previously known from isogeny-based assumptions. These include smooth projective hashing, dual-mode PKE,
two-message statistically sender-private OT, and Naor-Reingold style PRF. These primitives are useful building blocks
for a wide range of cryptographic applications.


We introduce a new assumption over group actions called Linear Hidden Shift (LHS) assumption. We then present
some discussions on the security of the LHS assumption and we show that it implies symmetric KDM-secure encryption,
which in turn enables many other primitives that were not previously known from isogeny-based assumptions.},

Such a construction is unlikely to exist classically as Cryptomania is believed to be different from Minicrypt. In particular, by instantiating our construction using Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK), we provide the first round-optimal (2-message) quantum OT protocol secure in the random oracle model, and round-optimal extensions to string and k-out-of-n OT. At the heart of our construction lies a new method that allows us to prove properties on a received quantum state without revealing additional information on it, even in a non-interactive way, without public-key primitives, and/or with statistical guarantees when using an appropriate classical ZK protocol. We can notably prove that a state has been partially measured (with arbitrary constraints on the set of measured qubits), without revealing any additional information on this set. This notion can be seen as an analog of ZK to quantum states, and we expect it to be of independent interest as it extends complexity theory to quantum languages, as illustrated by the two new complexity classes we introduce, ZKstatesQIP and ZKstatesQMA.},

The number of experimental settings required to extract complete information about a device grows exponentially with its size, and so does the running time for processing the data generated by these experiments. Part of the problem is that tomography generates much more information than is usually sought. Taking a more targeted approach, we develop schemes that enable (i) estimating the fidelity of an experiment to a theoretical ideal description, (ii) learning which description within a reduced subset best matches the experimental data. Both these approaches yield a significant reduction in resources compared to tomography. In particular, we demonstrate that fidelity can be estimated from a number of simple experimental settings that is independent of the system size, removing an important roadblock for the experimental study of larger quantum information processing units.},

  abstract      = {Recent oracle separations [Kretschmer, TQC'21, Kretschmer et. al., STOC'23] have raised the tantalizing possibility of building quantum cryptography from sources of hardness that persist even if the polynomial hierarchy collapses. We realize this possibility by building quantum bit commitments and secure computation from unrelativized, well-studied mathematical problems that are conjectured to be hard for $\mathsf{P^{\#P}}$ -- such as approximating the permanents of complex Gaussian matrices, or approximating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits. Indeed, we show that as long as any one of the conjectures underlying sampling-based quantum advantage (e.g., BosonSampling, Random Circuit Sampling, IQP, etc.) is true, quantum cryptography can be based on the extremely mild assumption that $\mathsf{P^{\#P}} \not\subseteq \mathsf{(io)BQP/qpoly}$. We prove that the following hardness assumptions are equivalent. (1) The hardness of approximating the probability assigned to a randomly chosen string in the support of certain efficiently sampleable distributions (upto inverse polynomial multiplicative error).(2) The existence of one-way puzzles, where a quantum sampler outputs a pair of classical strings -- a puzzle and its key -- and where the hardness lies in finding the key corresponding to a random puzzle. These are known to imply quantum bit commitments [Khurana and Tomer, STOC'24]. (3) The existence of state puzzles, or one-way state synthesis, where it is hard to synthesize a secret quantum state given a public classical identifier. These capture the hardness of search problems with quantum inputs (secrets) and classical outputs (challenges). These are the first constructions of quantum cryptographic primitives (one-way puzzles, quantum bit commitments, state puzzles) from concrete, well-founded mathematical assumptions that do not imply the existence of classical cryptography.},

However, their construction relied on post-quantumly secure indistinguishability obfuscation, a very strong primitive which is not known from standard cryptographic assumptions. In contrast, the primitives we use (namely, collapsing hash functions and a mild version of quantum homomorphic encryption) are much weaker and are implied by standard assumptions such as LWE. Our protocol is constructed using a general transformation which was designed by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) as a candidate method to compile any quantum nonlocal game into an argument system. Our main technical contribution is to analyze the soundness of this transformation when it is applied to a succinct self-test for Pauli measurements on maximally entangled states, the latter of which is a key component in the proof of MIP*=RE in quantum complexity.},

Here, we formally define and give schemes for quantum homomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such that quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our schemes allows for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for circuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion of the circuit (we use the "$\pi/8$" non-Clifford group gate, which is also known as the $T$-gate). More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a decryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of $T$-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with the total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of length given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's $T$-gate depth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant $T$-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption scheme. A further contribution of ours is to formally define the security of encryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks in both the public and private-key settings. In this context, we show the equivalence of several definitions. Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern cryptographic definitions, and can be seen as a quantum analogue of classical results establishing homomorphic encryption for circuits with a limited number of multiplication gates. Historically, such results appeared as precursors to the breakthrough result establishing classical fully homomorphic encryption.},

We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.},

  abstract      = {Gibbs sampling is a crucial computational technique used in physics, statistics, and many other scientific fields. For classical Hamiltonians, the most commonly used Gibbs sampler is the Metropolis algorithm, known for having the Gibbs state as its unique fixed point. For quantum Hamiltonians, designing provably correct Gibbs samplers has been more challenging. [TOV+11] introduced a novel method that uses quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the Marriot-Watrous rewinding technique to mimic the classical Metropolis algorithm for quantum Hamiltonians. The analysis of their algorithm relies upon the use of a boosted and shift-invariant version of QPE which may not exist [CKBG23]. Recent efforts to design quantum Gibbs samplers take a very different approach and are based on simulating Davies generators [CKBG23,CKG23,RWW23,DLL24]. Currently, these are the only provably correct Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians. We revisit the inspiration for the Metropolis-style algorithm of [TOV+11] and incorporate weak measurement to design a conceptually simple and provably correct quantum Gibbs sampler, with the Gibbs state as its approximate unique fixed point. Our method uses a Boosted QPE which takes the median of multiple runs of QPE, but we do not require the shift-invariant property. In addition, we do not use the Marriott-Watrous rewinding technique which simplifies the algorithm significantly.},

  abstract      = {Quantum computational advantage refers to an existence of computational tasks that are easy for quantum computing but hard for classical one. Unconditionally showing quantum advantage is beyond our current understanding of complexity theory, and therefore some computational assumptions are needed. Which complexity assumption is necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage? In this paper, we show that inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ) exist if and only if classically-secure one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) exist. As far as we know, this is the first time that a complete cryptographic characterization of quantum advantage is obtained. IV-PoQ capture various types of quantum advantage previously studied, such as sampling-based quantum advantage and searching-based one. Previous work [Morimae and Yamakawa, Crypto 2024] showed that IV-PoQ can be constructed from OWFs, but a construction of IV-PoQ from weaker assumptions was left open. Our result solves the open problem. OWPuzzs are one of the most fundamental quantum cryptographic primitives implied by many quantum cryptographic primitives weaker than one-way functions (OWFs). The equivalence between IV-PoQ and classically-secure OWPuzzs therefore highlights that if there is no quantum advantage, then these fundamental primitives do not exist. The equivalence also means that quantum advantage is an example of the applications of OWPuzzs. Except for commitments, no application of OWPuzzs was known before. Our result shows that quantum advantage is another application of OWPuzzs, which solves the open question of [Chung, Goldin, and Gray, Crypto 2024]. Moreover, it is the first quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) application of OWPuzzs.},

Building on the framework of Broadbent and Jeffery and recent results in the area of instantaneous non-local quantum computation, we show how to construct quantum gadgets that allow perfect correction of the errors which occur during the homomorphic evaluation of T gates on encrypted quantum data. Our scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and requires no computational assumptions besides those already used by the classical scheme. The size of our quantum gadget depends on the space complexity of the classical decryption function -- which aligns well with the current efforts to minimize the complexity of the decryption function. Our scheme (or slight variants of it) offers a number of additional advantages such as ideal compactness, the ability to supply gadgets "on demand", circuit privacy for the evaluator against passive adversaries, and a three-round scheme for blind delegated quantum computation which puts only very limited demands on the quantum abilities of the client.},

Our compiler uses any quantum homomorphic encryption scheme (Mahadev, FOCS 2018; Brakerski, CRYPTO 2018) satisfying a natural form of correctness with respect to auxiliary (quantum) input. The homomorphic encryption scheme is used as a cryptographic mechanism to simulate the effect of spatial separation, and is required to evaluate $k-1$ prover strategies (out of $k$) on encrypted queries. In conjunction with the rich literature on (entangled) multi-prover non-local games starting from the celebrated CHSH game (Clauser, Horne, Shimonyi and Holt, Physical Review Letters 1969), our compiler gives a broad framework for constructing mechanisms to classically verify quantum advantage.},

  abstract      = {We present a step towards the goal of producing a general cryptographic 'compilation' procedure which can translate any entangled nonlocal game into a single-prover interactive protocol while preserving quantum completeness and soundness, using cryptography to simulate the separation between the provers. A candidate for such a procedure was introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC '23), who defined a black-box cryptographic compilation procedure that applies to any nonlocal game and showed that it preserves classical value. In this work, we make progress towards a full understanding of the quantum value of the single-prover protocols that result from applying the Kalai et al. compilation procedure to entangled games. For the special case of CHSH, we prove that the Tsirelson bound holds under the compilation procedure introduced by Kalai et al., and we also recover a strong version of the 'rigidity' property that makes CHSH so useful. As an application, we give a single-prover cryptographically sound classical verification protocol for BQP, and we prove its soundness using our CHSH rigidity analysis. Our protocol replicates the functionality of Mahadev's protocol (FOCS '18) but with two advantages: (1) the protocol is conceptually intuitive and requires fewer bespoke ingredients, and the soundness analysis is simpler and directly follows the analysis of the nonlocal case, and (2) the soundness analysis does not explicitly use the assumption of a TCF or an adaptive hardcore bit, and only requires QFHE as a black box (though currently the only known constructions of QFHE use TCFs).},

In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.},

An immediate byproduct of our result is that there is an efficient reduction from the Halting Problem to the problem of deciding whether a two-player nonlocal game has entangled value $1$ or at most $1/2$. Using a known connection, undecidability of the entangled value implies a negative answer to Tsirelson's problem: we show, by providing an explicit example, that the closure $C_{qa}$ of the set of quantum tensor product correlations is strictly included in the set $C_{qc}$ of quantum commuting correlations. Following work of (Fritz, Rev. Math. Phys. 2012) and (Junge et al., J. Math. Phys. 2011) our results provide a refutation of Connes' embedding conjecture from the theory of von Neumann algebras.},

  abstract      = {One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security. In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.},

It is invariant under symplectic transformations (displacements, rotations, and squeezing) and we conjecture that it is lower bounded by $\ln\pi +1$ within the convex set of Wigner-positive states. It reaches this lower bound for Gaussian pure states, which are natural minimum-uncertainty states. This conjecture bears a resemblance with the Wehrl-Lieb conjecture, and we prove it over the subset of passive states of the harmonic oscillator which are of particular relevance in quantum thermodynamics. Along the way, we present a simple technique to build a broad class of Wigner-positive states exploiting an optical beam splitter and reveal an unexpectedly simple convex decomposition of extremal passive states. The Wigner entropy is anticipated to be a significant physical quantity, for example, in quantum optics where it allows us to establish a Wigner entropy-power inequality. It also opens a way towards stronger entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we define the Wigner-R\'enyi entropy of Wigner-positive states and conjecture an extended lower bound that is reached for Gaussian pure states.},

  abstract      = {Nonlocality and its connections to entanglement are fundamental features of quantum mechanics that have found numerous applications in quantum information science. A set of correlations is said to be nonlocal if it cannot be reproduced by spacelike-separated parties sharing randomness and performing local operations. An important practical consideration is that the runtime of the parties has to be shorter than the time it takes light to travel between them. One way to model this restriction is to assume that the parties are computationally bounded. We therefore initiate the study of nonlocality under computational assumptions and derive the following results: (a) We define the set $\mathsf{NeL}$ (not-efficiently-local) as consisting of all bipartite states whose correlations arising from local measurements cannot be reproduced with shared randomness and \emph{polynomial-time} local operations. (b) Under the assumption that the Learning With Errors problem cannot be solved in \emph{quantum} polynomial-time, we show that $\mathsf{NeL}=\mathsf{ENT}$, where $\mathsf{ENT}$ is the set of \emph{all} bipartite entangled states (pure and mixed). This is in contrast to the standard notion of nonlocality where it is known that some entangled states, e.g. Werner states, are local. In essence, we show that there exist (efficient) local measurements producing correlations that cannot be reproduced through shared randomness and quantum polynomial-time computation. (c) We prove that if $\mathsf{NeL}=\mathsf{ENT}$ unconditionally, then $\mathsf{BQP}\neq\mathsf{PP}$. In other words, the ability to certify all bipartite entangled states against computationally bounded adversaries gives a non-trivial separation of complexity classes. (d) Using (c), we show that a certain natural class of 1-round delegated quantum computation protocols that are sound against $\mathsf{PP}$ provers cannot exist.},

Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in [M.-O. Renou et al, Nature 600, 625-629, 2021], a decisive argument was presented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers. In this work, we demonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers is indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation locality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to the states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We observe that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was derived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By starting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive a combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties analogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that the conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and representation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the state space. We thus conclude that complex numbers are a mere convenience in quantum theory.},

We are able to prove  information-theoretic lower bounds in the GGAM for the discrete logarithm assumption, as well as for non-standard assumptions recently introduced in the setting of threshold and identification schemes on group actions. Unfortunately, in a natural quantum version of the GGAM, the discrete logarithm assumption does not hold. 

To this end we also introduce the weaker Quantum Algebraic Group Action Model (QAGAM), where every set element (in superposition) output by an adversary is required to have an explicit representation relative to known elements. In contrast to the Quantum Generic Group Action Model, in the QAGAM we are able to analyze the hardness of group action assumptions: We prove (among other things) the equivalence between the discrete logarithm assumption and non-standard assumptions recently introduced in the setting of QROM security for Password-Authenticated Key Exchange, Non-Interactive Key Exchange, and Public-Key Encryption.},

  abstract      = {This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon need pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully-integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-determistically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states - necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a `ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time-steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such questions.},

The most prominent application is the one-way quantum computer, with the cluster state as its universal resource. Here we demonstrate the principles of MBQC using deterministically generated graph states of up to 7 qubits, in a system of trapped atomic ions. Firstly we implement a universal set of operations for quantum computing. Secondly we demonstrate a family of measurement-based quantum error correction codes, and show their improved performance as the code length is increased. We show that all our graph states violate a multipartite Bell inequality and are therefore capable of information processing tasks that cannot be described by a local hidden variable model. The methods presented can directly be scaled up to generate graph states of several tens of qubits.},

By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated to produce long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields, in a prototypical example of a quantum simulator. Here we review the theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the preparation of complex equilibrium states, the study of dynamical processes in these many-body interacting quantum systems, and the use of this platform for optimization and other tasks. The use of such quantum simulators for studying spin models may inform our understanding of exotic quantum materials and shed light on the behavior of interacting quantum systems that cannot be modeled with conventional computers.},

Since Richard Feynman's famous "plenty of room at the bottom" lecture, hinting at the notion of novel devices employing quantum mechanics, the quantum information community has taken gigantic strides in understanding the potential applications of a quantum computer and laid the foundational requirements for building one. We believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface code. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting field has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future.},

This control uses three fixed frequencies for all single-qubit gates and a unique frequency detuning pattern for each qubit in the cell.

  abstract      = {Verifying quantum states is central to certifying the correct operation of various quantum information processing tasks. In particular, in measurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are generated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification protocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are particularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a single state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol currently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the state, where $n$ is the size of the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more resource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires $O(n^5\log{n})$ copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a probability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also enables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph states. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is non-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph states that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit and continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the resource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de Finetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our protocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and therefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not increase the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling's bound also makes our protocol robust: our protocol accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph states.},

Importantly, this polynomial increase in sample complexity can be substantially improved to polylogarithmic if the learning algorithm in question only requires non-adaptive, single-copy measurements. Among other applications, this allows us to generalize the classical shadow framework to the non-i.i.d. setting while only incurring a comparatively small loss in sample efficiency. We use rigorous quantum information theory to prove our main results. In particular, we leverage permutation invariance and randomized single-copy measurements to derive a new quantum de Finetti theorem that mainly addresses measurement outcome statistics and, in turn, scales much more favorably in Hilbert space dimension.},

In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).},

Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a promising approach for realizing BQC. To obtain reliable results in blind MBQC, it is crucial to verify whether the resource graph states are accurately prepared in the adversarial scenario. However, previous verification protocols for this task are too resource consuming or noise susceptible to be applied in practice. Here, we propose a robust and efficient protocol for verifying arbitrary graph states with any prime local dimension in the adversarial scenario, which leads to a robust and efficient protocol for verifying the resource state in blind MBQC. Our protocol requires only local Pauli measurements and is thus easy to realize with current technologies. Nevertheless, it can achieve the optimal scaling behaviors with respect to the system size and the target precision as quantified by the infidelity and significance level, which has never been achieved before. Notably, our protocol can exponentially enhance the scaling behavior with the significance level.},

Although various universal resource states have been proposed so far, it was open whether only two Pauli bases are enough for both of universal measurement-based quantum computing and its verification. In this paper, we construct a universal hypergraph state that only requires $X$ and $Z$-basis measurements for universal measurement-based quantum computing. We also show that universal measurement-based quantum computing on our hypergraph state can be verified in polynomial time using only $X$ and $Z$-basis measurements. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate an advantage of our hypergraph state, we construct a verifiable blind quantum computing protocol that requires only $X$ and $Z$-basis measurements for the client.},

The idea is that a classical party (client) instructs a quantum party (server) to generate a qubit to the server's side that is random, unknown to the server but known to the client. Such task is only possible under computational assumptions. In this contribution we define a simpler (basic) primitive consisting of only BB84 states, and give a protocol that realizes this primitive and that is secure against the strongest possible adversary (an arbitrarily deviating malicious server). The specific functions used, were constructed based on known trapdoor one-way functions, resulting to the security of our basic primitive being reduced to the hardness of the Learning With Errors problem. We then give a number of extensions, building on this basic module: extension to larger set of states (that includes non-Clifford states); proper consideration of the abort case; and verifiablity on the module level. The latter is based on "blind self-testing", a notion we introduced, proved in a limited setting and conjectured its validity for the most general case.},

In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state $\rho$, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which $\rho$ universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of $\rho$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain "magic" directions. If the polarization of $\rho$ along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

Prior to our work, it was not known whether even subexponentially many single-qubit measurements could suffice to certify arbitrary states. This resolves the main open question of Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (FOCS 2024, QIP 2024). Our algorithm also showcases the power of adaptive measurements: within each copy of the lab state, previous measurement outcomes dictate how subsequent qubit measurements are made. We show that the adaptivity is necessary, by proving an exponential lower bound on the number of copies needed for any nonadaptive single-qubit measurement algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Characterizing increasingly complex quantum systems is a central task in quantum information science, yet experimental costs often scale prohibitively with system size. Certifying key properties -- such as entanglement, circuit complexity, and quantum magic -- using simple local measurements is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we introduce a highly general certification framework based on a physical phenomenon that we call localizable quantumness: for generic many-body states, essential quantum properties are robustly preserved within the projected ensembles on small subsystems after performing local projective measurements on the rest of the system. Leveraging this insight, we develop certification protocols that certify global properties by witnessing them on a small, accessible subsystem. Our method dramatically reduces experimental cost by relying solely on local Pauli measurements, while achieving constant sample complexity, constant-level noise robustness, and soundness for mixed states -- exponentially improving the sample complexity and overcoming major limitations of previous methods. We further present a random-basis variant to certify state fidelity, with numerical evidence strongly suggesting it maintains constant sample complexity and robustness for generic states, representing a substantial improvement over existing methods. Our results provide a practical, scalable toolkit for certifying large-scale quantum processors and offer a novel lens for understanding complex many-body quantum systems.},

  abstract      = {Quantum fidelity estimation is essential for benchmarking quantum states and processes on noisy quantum devices. While stabilizer operations form the foundation of fault-tolerant quantum computing, non-stabilizer resources further enable universal quantum computation through state injection. In this work, we propose several efficient fidelity estimation protocols for both quantum states and channels within the resource theory of nonstabilizerness, focusing on qudit systems with odd prime dimensions. Our protocols require measuring only a constant number of phase-space point operator expectation values, with operators selected randomly according to an importance weighting scheme tailored to the target state. Notably, we demonstrate that mathematically defined nonstabilizerness measures--such as Wigner rank and mana--quantify the sample complexity of the proposed protocols, thereby endowing them with a clear operational interpretation in the fidelity estimation task. This connection reveals a fundamental trade-off: while fidelity estimation for general quantum states and channels requires resources that scale exponentially with their nonstabilizerness, the task remains tractable for states and channels that admit efficient classical simulation.},

Efficient verification of these states, especially in the adversarial scenario, is a key to various applications, including quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum networks. However, little is known about this topic in the adversarial scenario. Here we initiate a systematic study of pure-state verification in the adversarial scenario. In particular, we introduce a general method for determining the minimal number of tests required by a given strategy to achieve a given precision. In the case of homogeneous strategies, we can even derive an analytical formula. Furthermore, we propose a general recipe to verifying pure quantum states in the adversarial scenario by virtue of protocols for the nonadversarial scenario. Thanks to this recipe, the resource cost for verifying an arbitrary pure state in the adversarial scenario is comparable to the counterpart for the nonadversarial scenario, and the overhead is at most three times for high-precision verification. Our recipe can readily be applied to efficiently verify bipartite pure states, stabilizer states, hypergraph states, weighted graph states, and Dicke states in the adversarial scenario, even if only local projective measurements are accessible.

We find the optimal strategy in this case and show that quadratically fewer total measurements are needed to verify to within a given fidelity than in published results for quantum state tomography, Bell test, or fidelity estimation protocols. We also give efficient verification protocols for any stabilizer state. Additionally, we show that requiring that the strategy be constructed from local, non-adaptive and non-collective measurements only incurs a constant-factor penalty over a strategy without these restrictions.},

  abstract      = {A client can delegate a quantum computation to a powerful remote server while ensuring the privacy and the integrity of its computation via Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC). Thanks to recent results making them noise-robust and resource-efficient, proofs-of-concept implementations of generic SDQC protocols have already been demonstrated. Yet, the requirements for implementing them are still too stringent to go beyond this step while maintaining high security expectations. To further reduce their physical resource cost, we show how to realise SDQC using weak coherent pulses (WCPs) instead of single photons. More precisely, we construct a protocol which guarantees that, among a sufficiently large batch of transmitted WCPs, at least one contained only a single photon. This holds even if the adversary controls the transmittance of the photonic link connecting the client and the server. Our protocol's security is proven in the composable Abstract Cryptography (AC) framework. This batch can then be fed to known quantum privacy amplification techniques to prepare a single secure qubit in the X-Y plane, which can be used in any composable SDQC protocol which relies on the secure preparation of single qubits. Furthermore, the guarantee on the batch of states can also be used for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) where the privacy amplification step is classical. In doing so, we address a weakness in the standard security proof of the decoy state method. While our protocol can be instantiated with any number of different intensities for the WCPs, using only two intensities already shows improved scaling at low transmittance, thus opening the possibility of increasing the distance between the client and the server.},

Our main tools are two novel distillation protocols that turn secret-dependent noise into secret-independent noise. The first one is run by the verifier and acts on its noisy gates, while the second and more complex one is run entirely on the prover's device and acts on states provided by the verifier. Both are required to overcome the leakage induced by secret-dependent noise. We use these protocols to prepare states in the X-Y-plane whose noise is overwhelmingly secret-independent, which then allows us to verify with exponential confidence arbitrary fault-tolerant BQP computations.},

  abstract      = {The rapid advance of quantum hardware is spotlighting pre-fault-tolerant tasks that may no longer be efficiently validated by classical means and are likely to run on potentially untrusted remote quantum servers. This motivates problem-independent verification protocols with rigorous guarantees. The Verifiable Blind Quantum Computation (VBQC) protocol provides delegated computation where the composable security spans the confidentiality and integrity of the computation. However, the success of these cryptographic protocols, especially their low space overhead, is unfortunately confined to problems that admit an algorithm whose output can be amplified through majority voting toward the correct solution. This leaves various notable near-term applications relying on observable estimation without efficient verification protocols. To address these needs, we introduce a protocol implementing Secure Delegated Observable Estimation (SDOE), which efficiently verifies observable estimation performed on an untrusted quantum machine. More precisely, it guarantees that the computed estimate is within some $ε>0$ of the true expectation value or else it aborts. The required overhead is limited to adding test rounds that are not more complex than the unprotected computation that needs to be performed to implement the desired measurement on a given fiducial state; and in addition, the security error is negligible in the total number of rounds of the protocol.},

  abstract      = {We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to verification and benchmarking of quantum computing, implementing it on an ion-trap quantum computer. Unlike previous information-theoretically secure verification protocols, which typically require quantum communication between client and server, our approach is implemented entirely on-chip. This eliminates the need for a quantum client and significantly enhances practicality. We perform tomography to justify the additionally required assumption that the noise is independent of the secret used to prepare the Server's single-qubit states. We quantify the soundness error which may be caused by residual secret dependencies. We demonstrate our protocol on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processing unit, using qubit measurements and resets to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices. To our knowledge, these are the largest verified measurement-based quantum computations performed to date. Our results pave the way for more accessible and efficient verification and benchmarking strategies in near-term quantum devices, enabling robust performance assessment without the added cost of external quantum infrastructure.},

  abstract      = {This perspective outlines promising pathways and critical obstacles on the road to developing useful quantum computing applications, drawing on insights from the Google Quantum AI team. We propose a five-stage framework for this process, spanning from theoretical explorations of quantum advantage to the practicalities of compilation and resource estimation. For each stage, we discuss key trends, milestones, and inherent scientific and sociological impediments. We argue that two central stages -- identifying concrete problem instances expected to exhibit quantum advantage, and connecting such problems to real-world use cases -- represent essential and currently under-resourced challenges. Throughout, we touch upon related topics, including the promise of generative artificial intelligence for aspects of this research, criteria for compelling demonstrations of quantum advantage, and the future of compilation as we enter the era of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

  abstract      = {The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using solely classical communication. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications and functionalities on quantum processors have been performed in ad-hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here, we report on the design and implementation of the first architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the architecture's capability to execute applications in high-level software, by implementing it as a quantum network operating system -- QNodeOS -- and executing test programs including a delegated computation from a client to a server on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware, by multitasking different applications on a quantum network for the first time. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an additional driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ atom. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in the domain of quantum network programming, and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.},
